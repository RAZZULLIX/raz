# RAZ Compression Framework

Welcome to the world of RAZ (Revolutionary Atlas of Zippers) Compression Framework, a revolutionary approach to data compression that's set to redefine the way we handle digital information. 

## Introduction

At the core of RAZ lies a groundbreaking framework designed to intelligently segment and compress data using a suite of optimized algorithms. Each segment of data is analyzed and compressed with the most suitable algorithm, from custom bit reduction techniques to advanced methods like run-length encoding and dictionary-based compression.

## Features

- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: RAZ selects the most efficient compression algorithm for each data segment, maximizing compression efficiency.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Smart instruction sets dictate the compression and decompression processes with minimal file size impact.
- **Future-Proof Design**: Easily integrate new compression methods or enhance existing ones without needing decompressor upgrades.
- **High-Speed Compression and Decompression**: Experience rapid processing, thanks to the framework's simple yet powerful architecture.
- **Adaptable for Various Applications**: Ideal for cloud storage, streaming services, and more, significantly reducing storage costs and enhancing transmission efficiency.

## Working Demo

Explore our demo featuring a custom bit reduction algorithm that exemplifies RAZ's potential. While it's the first iteration and unoptimized, it never fails to showcase the framework's reliability in compressing and decompressing data.
