# RAZ Compression Framework

The RAZ (Revolutionary Atlas of Zippers) Compression Framework is a versatile tool designed to enhance data compression and decompression through a suite of optimized algorithms.

## Introduction

RAZ intelligently segments and compresses data using a variety of optimized algorithms. Each data segment is analyzed and compressed with the most suitable algorithm from a custom dictionary of methods.

## Features

- **Instruction-Based Compression**: Each byte of data starts with an instruction byte that dictates the compression method. Following the instruction, a dictionary of affected bytes is appended, and 1 or 2 bytes indicate the length of the chunk of bytes that will be affected.

- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: RAZ selects the most efficient compression algorithm for each data segment by analyzing the segment and applying the appropriate instruction-based method.

- **Minimal Overhead**: Smart instruction sets guide the compression and decompression processes with minimal impact on file size.

- **Byte Analysis for Scoring**: Each byte position in the data is analyzed to determine its potential for compression:
  1. **Initial Analysis**: Evaluating how well each byte can be compressed using different algorithms.
  2. **Instruction and Dictionary Formation**: Creating an instruction byte, followed by a dictionary of affected bytes, and determining the length of the chunk to be compressed.
  3. **Scoring Mechanism**: Assigning scores based on compression ratios (higher score, lower size, higher compression).

- **Future Machine Learning Integration**: The framework is designed to incorporate machine learning algorithms in the future to enhance compression efficiency. The steps include:
  1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data on compression performance for different data segments.
  2. **Training Models**: Using this data to train ML algorithms to predict the most efficient compression instructions.
  3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Implementing ML models to dynamically select the best compression algorithm in real-time, maximizing compression efficiency and effectiveness.

## Working Demo

A demo featuring a custom bit reduction algorithm called **bitredux** is available to showcase RAZ's capabilities. **Bitredux** works by analyzing the data to identify and reduce the number of bits needed to represent each byte, leveraging patterns and redundancies to achieve compression. This initial version demonstrates the framework's reliability by compressing and decompressing a single file.
